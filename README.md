## Functional

The form has the following fields:
* Name (string)
* Phone (string)
*Gender(boolean)
* Age (number)
Each field must have a validation rule. The entry is added only when
absence of errors. The form and table are on the same screen, so when submitting
form data, the data in the table is updated automatically, and the form fields
cleared
